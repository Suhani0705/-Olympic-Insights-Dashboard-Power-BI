The Olympic Insights Dashboard is an advanced Power BI project designed to visualize and analyze over a century of Olympic Games data — spanning from 1896 to 2016. The objective of this dashboard is to uncover patterns, performance trends, and country-wise dominance through meaningful visual storytelling.

The dataset combines athlete records, medal counts, and NOC region mappings to provide a complete analytical view of Olympic history. Using Power BI, I transformed this raw dataset into an interactive analytical experience featuring modern visuals, DAX-driven insights, and dynamic filters.

## ✨ Key Features:

🧭 Dynamic KPI Cards – Built using Card with States (by OKViz) to track Gold, Silver, Bronze, Total Medals & Athletes with trend-based color changes.

🌍 Mapbox Visuals – Display global medal distribution and identify dominant regions.

📈 Trend Analysis – Line charts to show the evolution of medals and participation across decades.

🥇 Leaderboard View – Highlights top-performing nations and their medal counts.

🏋️ Sport & Gender Analysis – Breakdown of participation across sports and gender categories.

☁️ Word Cloud & Chiclet Slicers – Enhance interactivity and storytelling with creative visuals.

This dashboard is a celebration of 120 years of Olympic excellence, showing how data can narrate the story of human achievement. It combines design, analytics, and emotion, turning statistics into a journey through time.
